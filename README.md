# ðŸ“Ž Clippy for Teams: Conversational Teams Bot with Teams AI Library

This is a conversational bot for Microsoft Teams that impersonates Clippy that helps people answer questions about Microsoft products. Clippy loves all Microsoft products and is always ready to help users make the most of them. In the project, the bot uses the `gpt-35-turbo-16k` model to chat with Teams users and respond in a polite and respectful manner, staying within the scope of the conversation.

Clippy for Teams bot is built using the Teams Toolkit and Teams AI library, which provides the capabilities to build AI-based Teams applications.
